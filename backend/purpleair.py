"""Live PurpleAir sensor fetcher + same-day neighbor-feature computation.

The v3b model's single most important feature (nbr_pm25_50km, ~37% of total
importance) is the mean PM2.5 of OTHER sensors within 50km ON THE SAME DAY.
At training (pipeline/03_train_enhanced.py) this is computed per (sensor, date)
with a BallTree over that day's readings. To reproduce it at inference WITHOUT
train/serve skew, the backend must use LIVE same-day PurpleAir readings — not a
static historical mean.

This module:
  1. fetch_live_sensors(): one bounding-box call to PurpleAir's /v1/sensors
     live endpoint for all outdoor Texas sensors, QC'd to fresh + trustworthy.
  2. compute_neighbor_features(): replicates the training BallTree computation
     with census-tract centroids as query points and live sensors as the
     reference set, returning (nbr_pm25_50km, nbr_count_50km, nbr_std_50km).

CRITICAL correctness notes:
  - Use pm2.5_atm, the raw ATM-channel mass conc. Training used pm2.5_atm
    (pipeline/06 PA_HISTORY_FIELDS) renamed straight to the model target.
    Do NOT apply the EPA Barkjohn correction here — training data was raw.
  - 50km radius == 50.0/6371.0 radians on a haversine BallTree, identical to
    training (pipeline/03 line ~314).
  - Fallback for tracts with zero live neighbors == live statewide same-day
    mean, matching training's groupby(date) statewide-mean fallback. NO 100km
    widening tier (training never widened — adding one is train/serve skew).

    pm2.5_atm only when the rolling average is missing.

    WHY the 24-hour field: the model trains on DAILY MEANS (PurpleAir history
    pulled with average=1440), so the rolling 24h average is the train-consistent
    semantics for the dominant neighbor features. Instantaneous pm2.5_atm both
    (a) injects diurnal swings the model never saw and (b) passes through
    single-reading sensor glitches — e.g. a Dallas sensor was observed reading
    atm=3326 µg/m³ while its 24h average was a sane 33.8. The 24h field smooths
    glitches AND keeps genuine smoke-event signal.

    Returns an empty list on any failure (no key, HTTP error, too few sensors)
